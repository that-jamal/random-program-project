# random-program-projekt
(first personal project)
this project is a program that gives the user a random game that will be disaplyed in the frame, if the user likes a game in the program he can use the game list to find the game for later, if the user is interested in the game and wanna know more about the game the user can visit the original link located underneath the frame.

(functions and buttons)
The like button likes a game and keeps it liked until u reload the page or unlike it.
The NEXT button disaplay's a random game in the frame.
The arrow close to the NEXT button is a list that the user can use to pick what game will be displayd in the frame without getting a random one.
The zoom in button to the left down is used to zoom in on the current displayed game in the frame. (Note some games glitch out and wont work when zoom is active, no reasons found.)
